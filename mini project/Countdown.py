# Mini Project – Countdown Timer (with 1-second gap)
 
# Goal: 
# Print a countdown before something “exciting” happens (like “Launching…” or 
# “Happy New Year!”). 
# Concepts Used: for loop, range(), and the time module. 


import time

count = int(input("Enter the counter number :-"))

print("\n Countdown Strats Now")
for i in range(count,0,-1):
    print(i)
    time.sleep(1)

print("WHOOO! HAPPY NEW YEAR  ")
